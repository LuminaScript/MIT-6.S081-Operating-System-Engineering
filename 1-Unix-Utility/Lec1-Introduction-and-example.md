## Operating System Purpose

### Hardware Abstraction

Simplifies complex hardware operations by providing standard interfaces to interact with hardware components.

### Multiplexing

Allows multiple processes to share hardware resources efficiently without conflicts.

### Isolation

Ensures that processes operate independently, preventing them from interfering with one another's execution.

### Sharing

Enables controlled access to resources among different processes or users.

### Security

Protects system integrity and user data from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.

### Performance Optimization

Manages resources to maximize efficiency and system throughput.

### Versatility

Supports a wide range of applications and adapts to various use cases and hardware configurations.

## Challenges in OS Design

### Efficiency vs. Abstraction

Balancing high performance with the provision of user-friendly abstractions over hardware.

### Powerful vs. Simple APIs

Offering robust and comprehensive functionalities while maintaining intuitive and easy-to-use interfaces.

### Flexibility vs. Security

Allowing system extensibility and customization without compromising security measures.

## OS Layers

### User Applications
Programs and tools that users interact with directly, such as:
- Text editors (`vi`)
- Compilers (`gcc`)
- Databases

### Kernel Services
Core functionalities that manage system resources and provide services to applications:
- **Process Management**: Handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
- **Memory Allocation**: Manages system memory allocation and deallocation for processes.
- **File Systems**: Controls file operations, including reading, writing, organizing files, and directories.
- **Access Control**: Enforces security policies to restrict or grant access to system resources.
- **Additional Services**
   - User management
   - Inter-process communication (IPC)
   - Networking
   - Time management
   - Terminal handling

### Hardware
Physical components of the computer system:
- CPU
- RAM
- Disk drives
- Network interfaces

## System Calls (User Space API)
System calls provide an interface for user applications to request services from the kernel.
- `open`: Opens a file and returns a file descriptor.
- `fork`: Creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.
- `write`: Writes data to a file descriptor.
- `read`: Reads data from a file descriptor.
- `exec`: Replaces the current process image with a new program.

## Code Examples

### 1. Copy Input to Output (`copy.c`)

Copies data from standard input to standard output.

```c
// copy.c: copy input to output.

#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int main() {
  char buf[64];

  while (1) {
    int n = read(0, buf, sizeof(buf));
    if (n <= 0)
      break;
    write(1, buf, n);
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

---

### 2. Echo Command (`echo.c`)

Prints command-line arguments to standard output, similar to the `echo` command.

```c
// echo.c

#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
    write(1, argv[i], strlen(argv[i]));
    if (i + 1 < argc) {
      write(1, " ", 1);
    } else {
      write(1, "\n", 1);
    }
  }
  exit(0);
}
```

---

### 3. Executing a Program (`exec.c`)

Replaces the current process with a new program using `exec`.

```c
// exec.c: replace a process with an executable file

#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int main() {
  char *argv[] = {"echo", "this", "is", "echo", 0};

  exec("echo", argv);

  printf("exec failed!\n");

  exit(0);
}
```

---

### 4. Process Creation (`fork.c`)

Demonstrates the creation of a new process using `fork`.

```c
// fork.c: create a new process

#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int main() {
  int pid = fork();

  printf("fork() returned %d\n", pid);

  if (pid == 0) {
    printf("child\n");
  } else {
    printf("parent\n");
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

---

### 5. Fork and Execute (`forkexec.c`)

Creates a child process that runs a new program using `fork` and `exec`.

```c
// forkexec.c: fork then exec

#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int main() {
  int pid = fork();
  if (pid == 0) {
    char *argv[] = {"echo", "THIS", "IS", "ECHO", 0};
    exec("echo", argv);
    printf("exec failed!\n");
    exit(1);
  } else {
    printf("parent waiting\n");
    int status;
    wait(&status);
    printf("the child exited with status %d\n", status);
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

---

### 6. File Creation and Writing (`open.c`)

Shows how to create a new file and write data to it.

```c
// open.c: create a file, write to it.

#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"
#include "kernel/fcntl.h"

int main() {
  int fd = open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREATE);
  write(fd, "ooo\n", 4);
  close(fd);

  exit(0);
}
```

---

### 7. Listing Directory Contents (`list.c`)

Lists all file names in the current directory.

```c
// list.c: list file names in the current directory

#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

struct dirent {
  ushort inum;
  char name[14];
};

int main() {
  int fd = open(".", 0);
  struct dirent e;

  while (read(fd, &e, sizeof(e)) == sizeof(e)) {
    if (e.name[0] != '\0') {
      printf("%s\n", e.name);
    }
  }
  close(fd);

  exit(0);
}
```

---

### 8. Pipe Communication Within a Process (`pipe1.c`)

Demonstrates communication over a pipe within the same process.

```c
// pipe1.c: communication over a pipe

#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int main() {
  int fds[2];
  char buf[100];

  pipe(fds);

  write(fds[1], "this is pipe1\n", 14);
  int n = read(fds[0], buf, sizeof(buf));

  write(1, buf, n);

  exit(0);
}
```

---

### 9. Pipe Communication Between Processes (`pipe2.c`)

Shows inter-process communication using a pipe between parent and child processes.

```c
// pipe2.c: communication between two processes

#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int main() {
  int fds[2];
  char buf[100];

  pipe(fds);
  int pid = fork();

  if (pid == 0) {
    write(fds[1], "this is pipe2\n", 14);
    exit(0);
  } else {
    int n = read(fds[0], buf, sizeof(buf));
    write(1, buf, n);
    wait(0);
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

---

### 10. Output Redirection (`redirect.c`)

Runs a command and redirects its output to a file.

```c
// redirect.c: run a command with output redirected

#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "user/user.h"
#include "kernel/fcntl.h"

int main() {
  int pid = fork();

  if (pid == 0) {
    close(1);
    open("output.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREATE);
    char *argv[] = {"echo", "this", "is", "redirected", "echo", 0};
    exec("echo", argv);
    printf("exec failed!\n");
    exit(1);
  } else {
    wait(0);
  }

  exit(0);
}
```
